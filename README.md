# Yu-Gi-Oh Memory Game

This was an assignment for a Springboard project to make a memory game that does the following.

1. User should be able to start a new game.
2. Clicking a card should reveal what’s underneath it. The game should keep track and display the number of times cards have been turned over.
3. Users should only be able to see at most two cards at a time.
4. Clicking on two matching cards should be a “match” — those cards should stay face up. (Make sure this works only if you click on two different cards — clicking the same card twice shouldn’t count as a match!)
5. When clicking two cards that are not a match, they should stay turned over for at least 1 second before they flip over again
